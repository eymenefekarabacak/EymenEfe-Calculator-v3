# 🧮 Eymen Efe's Calculator v3.0

This is my first official Python project. It is a simple yet functional command-line calculator.

## ✨ Features
* **Infinite Loop:** The program keeps running until you choose to quit by pressing 'q'.
* **Error Handling:** Includes `try-except` blocks to prevent crashes when invalid numbers are entered.
* **Safe Division:** Prevents "Division by Zero" errors with a manual check.
* **Basic Operations:** Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulo (%).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Source Code:** Download `EymenEfe-Calculator-v3.py` and run it with Python.
2. **Direct Executable:** Go to the **Releases** section on the right and download the `.exe` file to run it directly on Windows without installing Python.
